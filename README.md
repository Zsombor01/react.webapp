# react.webapp

My main goal with this project is to explore React as deeply as i can and also, make something usefull for myself.

Here you can read a small "introduction" of all the components in this project.

App.jsx
The 'main' component where i combined all the components to get the current look of the page.

Time.jsx
I made a clock for the head of the website + added some animation to it with CSS.

Weather.jsx
Writes out the current weather in your location. (with the help of different APIs)

Crypto.jsx
Responsible for the current cryptocurrency prices to be written out on the page.  

News.jsx
Basically the second page of this react webb app where the user is able to check on the latest news in the world, with the help of an API. User can select from business, entertainment, general, health, science, sports and technology news. The user also able to choose languages.
I also used a react specific animation library called framer-motion, to make this section a bit cooler.

App.css
Responsible for all the styling on the page.
